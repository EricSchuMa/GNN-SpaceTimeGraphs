# Spatio-Temporal Graph Structure Learning for Traffic Forecasting

 1. Uses Structure Learning Convolution (extension of convolutions) to campture the graph structure.<br>
 STL uses the ChebNet operator to learn The global structure and the local structure of the graph. 
 The ChebNet operator is a kernel like structure that operated with the inputs of the node and passed
 through a non linearity, returns the outputs of the graph nodes.
 
 2. Uses Pseudo three dimensional convolution to capture temporal dependencies.<br>
